        This page is not just a website.  
        It is a small part of what I feel, something simple but honest.  
        Every moment here is chosen with care, every second means something.  
        If you are watching this, just know—this is made with pure intention 🩷

        Sometimes words are not enough,  
        so moments speak instead.  
        This is not perfection, but it is real.  
        And real things are always beautiful 🩷

        Not everything needs explanation.  
        Some things are just meant to be felt 🩷

        This is the end of the page,  
        but not the meaning behind it.
